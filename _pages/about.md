I'm a master's student at the Technical University of Munich, visiting researcher at the University of Oxford and researcher at the Masaryk University. My research involves applying game-theoretic techniques to the analysis and verification of stochastic multi-agent systems. In particular, I am interested in robust equilibria, which are stable against trembles.


## Things that I did

### Formal Methods
As a Research Assistant (+3 years), I maintained and developed dtControl, an open-source tool for representing symbolic controllers as decision trees and Automata Tutor, an online educational tool for automata theory and formal languages which is currently used by +50 universities across 5 continents.

### Machine Learning
Led various research and software development roles at TUM, Vay and IABG.
Other projects included developing a Swift SDK for the federated learning framework Flower, or teaching +100 students in two courses, twice a year, hands-on software engineering and machine learning at TUM.

## Things that I'm currently doing
Right now, I'm a visting researcher at the University of Oxford, working on probabilistic verification with a focus on game theory. In particular, I'm interested in computing robust equilibria in games with communication.
